3.2- had to add enclosing <div> around entire return() section in src/app.js in order for
React to parse it correctly; React can only technically return one element on render().

3.2- switched from React.createClass to the es6(future) class VariableName extends React.Component

// now on 3.3 2/18 11:11pm

7.2 installed Gulp as a global and --save-dev instead of just globally

8.1 Instead of using var filter as:
+  var filter = {};
+  if (req.query.priority)
+    filter.priority = req.query.priority;
+  if (req.query.status)
+    filter.status = req.query.status;

used req.query as find() arg, passing in query object data

8.2 for extends React.Component, had to bind (this)
loadData(filter) {
  $
    .ajax('/api/bugs', {data: filter})
    .done(function(data) {
      var jsonData = data;
      this.setState({bugs: jsonData});
    }.bind(this));
}

And in componentDidMount, could not pass in blank obj as default:
componentDidMount() {
  this.loadData();
}

NOT
componentDidMount() {
  this.loadData({});
}
-- the above causes the submit to load a blank object for filter.

8.3 had to bind     this.loadData = this.loadData.bind(this);
if something is changing state and is a function,
does not have access so have to bind to (this) to give
access through the react component (which is 'this')
